        Tx;Rx;GND Daisy-chain out
    Main board (probably LED controller):
        Silk "837-15084"
        CN1: Host 5V power in, ?V NFC-sub power out
        CN2: Host RS232 Tx;Rx;GND in, NFC-sub Tx;Rx out
        CN3: LED-Sub power and data(?) out
        DIPSW1: Set to hex nibble 8.

        Contains ATMega32 MCU
    NFC subboard:
        Sticker: Model "TN32MSEC003S"
        CN1: ?V power and Tx;Rx;GND in, Tx;Rx;GND ass'y CN daisy out.
        DIPSW1: Set to hex nibble 0.
        Contains ATmega168 MCU
        Contains ADM3202A RS232 transceiver IC
        Contains shielded RF circuit
        Entire non-ground-plane PCB area is visible through the chassis
        torx screws lol
    LED subboard:
        Silk: "837-15120"
        CN1: ?V power and Tx;Rx;GND in.
        Five RGB LEDs and a bunch of resistors
        No visible logic ICs..?
        No DIPSW.

JVS framing:
    E0 sync
    D0 escape (+1 to unescape)
    Checksum is sum of bytes after unescaping

Frame header:
    Frame length (including length byte itself)
    Address
    Sequence no, hopefully loops before hitting esc byte...
    Command byte

Bus addressing:
    Low nibble set using DIPSWs
    High nibble ???
    Daisy chaining mechanism unknown (RS232 wires probably multi-tap)
